# DFRobot Ultrasonic Sensor A02YYUW python driver

This repo is intended to make a configurable driver for the A02YYUW DFRobot ultrasonic driver.

## Hardware integration

The sensor uses the UART protocol to communicate. To integrate with a compatibile computer or microcontroller, connect the appropriate wires from the sensor to the UART bus pins of the MCU or use a UART to USB cable and connet to an available USB port of the compatible device. 

See the [Product Wiki](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/_A02YYUW_Waterproof_Ultrasonic_Sensor_SKU_SEN0311) for more info.
